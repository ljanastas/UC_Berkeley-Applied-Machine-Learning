    "In this notebook we will be revisiting the problem of digit classification on the MNIST data.  In doing so, we will introduce a new Python library, Theano, for working with neural networks.  Theano is a popular choice for neural networks as the same code can be run on either CPUs or GPUs.  GPUs greatly speed up the training and prediction, and is readily available. Amazon even offers GPU machines on EC2.  \n",

    "In part 1, we'll introduce Theano, and refresh ourselves on the MNIST dataset.  In part 2, we'll create a multi-layer neural network with a simple architechure, and train it using backpropagation.  Part 3 will introduce the convolutional architechure, which can be said to be doing 'deep learning' (also called feature learning or representation learning)."
